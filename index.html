          <p>I love working with people and technology to solve problems. For the majority of my working career this has resulted in roles that blend first and second tier Help Desk, System Administration (usually ticketing/CRM system design and administration) and Business Analysis. I find bringing order to chaos exciting! To me, every problem is a fresh mystery to solve and I really enjoy that.</p>
            
          <P>My current focus is on improving my coding/design skills with the intent of becoming a web developer. I really enjoy creating products that are easy to use, efficient, and (ideally) look aesthetically pleasing. </P>

          <p>Outside of technological interests I am an avid cook and Peloton devotee.</p>

            <h3>Blackjack</h3>
    
            <p>For this project the goal was to create a functioning blackjack simulation game with the ability to start a game, and add new cards. I chose to add a simple reset as well as it improves repeat gameplay. CSS and design styling of my own invention</P>
              <p>This Javascript project was incrementally more complex in its use of arrays, conditional logic, functions, and use of <strong>Math</strong> to return random numbers. </P>
            <p>I completed this project as part of the course work for Scrimba's Intro to Javascript.
