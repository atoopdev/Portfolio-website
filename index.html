          <h1>Amanda Toop</h1>
          <h2>Information Technology Specialist</h2>

          <p>I love working with people and technology to solve problems. I find bringing bringing order to chaos exciting! I find myself drawn towards any kind of project or process that involves research, interviewing users/stakeholders, and/or data analysis in order to solve problems - big or small. I find that at the surface level problems and proposed "solutions" share one thing in common - when you take the time to look at all the data you can frequently find the issue is quite different than originally assumed. To me, every problem is a fresh mystery to solve and I really enjoy that.</p>
          <p>I specialize in software administration - CRM and Service Desk (design, implementation, customization, and ongoing administration), user access management, business analysis (requirements gathering/research/planning/implementing new systems) as well as providing technical solutions and troubleshooting.</p>
          <P>Outside of the office, my main technology projects are - creating websites, working with ecommerce platforms like eBay and Poshmark, as well as learning more about digital marketing. I also frequently help friends create and optimize their social media profiles.</P>
          <p>Outside of technological interests I am an avid cook and Peloton devotee.</p>

            <h3>How to Sell Clothing Online Website</h3>
          
            <p>"How to Sell Clothing Online" is a project I decided to implement as part of a plan to create a sandbox for exploring new ideas and technology outside of the area I typically work. The goal was to build a site and then spend time optimizing both the content and technology, while also having a project I can always go back to when I want to explore topics like graphic design, SEO, or social media marketing. </p>
            <P>The main hurdle of this project was optimizing Wordpress. I chose a fairly inexpensive hosting plan and this ended up being problematic in terms of site speed. Ultimately I resolved the issue by switching the site theme to Astra and using the plugin AMP. </P>
            <P>I really enjoyed learning about new-to-me subjects like Google Analytics, Pinterest marketing, and tools like CoSchedule's Headline Analyzer.</P>
