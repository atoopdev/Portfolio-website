          <p>I love working with people and technology to solve problems. For the majority of my working career this has resulted in roles that blend first and second tier Help Desk, System Administration (usually ticketing/CRM system design and administration) and Business Analysis. I find bringing bringing order to chaos exciting! To me, every problem is a fresh mystery to solve and I really enjoy that.</p>
            
          <P>My current focus is on improving my coding/design skills with the intent of becoming a web developer. I really enjoy creating products that are easy to use, efficient, and (ideally) look aesthetically pleasing. </P>

          <p>Outside of technological interests I am an avid cook and Peloton devotee.</p>

    <h3>How to Sell Clothing Online Website</h3>
  
    <p>"How to Sell Clothing Online" is a project I decided to implement as part of a plan to create a sandbox for exploring new ideas and technology outside of the area I typically work. The goal was to build a site and then spend time optimizing both the content and technology, while also having a project I can always go back to when I want to explore topics like graphic design, SEO, or social media marketing. </p>
    <P>The main hurdle of this project was optimizing Wordpress. I chose a fairly inexpensive hosting plan and this ended up being problematic in terms of site speed. Ultimately I resolved the issue by switching the site theme to Astra and using the plugin AMP. </P>
    <P>I really enjoyed learning about new-to-me subjects like Google Analytics, Pinterest marketing, and tools like CoSchedule's Headline Analyzer.</P>
