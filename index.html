          <p>I'm a leader driven by the pursuit of improvement. I love working with people and technology to solve problems. I find bringing bringing order to chaos exciting!  To me, every problem is a fresh adventure and I really enjoy that.  Always on the lookout for ways to enhance processes and elevate service, all while fostering positive relationships.</p>
            
          <p>I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends. I'm currently working on a AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Certification, and I'm excited to explore new opportunities in technology leadership. Check out my portfolio website to see some of my recent projects and get a sense of my approach to problem-solving and collaboration.</p>

          <!-- <p>Outside of technological interests I am an avid cook, learning Aikido, and Peloton devotee. On the weekends you would find me at a local museum or gallery, or trying a new restaurant in the International District.</p> -->
